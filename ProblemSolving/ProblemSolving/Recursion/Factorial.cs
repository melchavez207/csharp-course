    /// What is recursion?
    /// It is a technique where a function or method calls itself.
    /// 
    /// Key points:
    /// - We need a base scenario (to prevent inifinite calls)
    /// - We need to keep the process small
    /// - We need to divide the problem
    /// 
    /// When ot use it?
    /// - It helps us to divide a problem
    /// - It helps to iterate over trees or graphs
